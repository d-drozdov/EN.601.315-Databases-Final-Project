- Docker

### Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `docker compose up -d`
4. To connect to this db use the following connection string: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`





# Questions
What is the average cost of roof and wall construction materials for buildings located in each census region?

How does the average annual electricity and natural gas consumption compare across different principal building activities and building owner types?

What is the average electricity and natural gas consumption for buildings that have undergone specific types of renovations (like HVAC equipment upgrade, insulation upgrade) compared to those that haven't?

What is the average electricity consumption per square foot for buildings, categorized by their construction year range? Usage type?

Do elevators and escalators significantly affect a  building's overall energy consumption?

Which industry is the most energy intensive? (For example, healthcare vs. foodservice) Which one uses the least energy?

Is there a correlation between the number of employees and electricity consumption in buildings?

For buildings that receive significant daylight (>50% daylight shining on the building), how does their electricity consumption for lighting compare to those with less daylight?

Compare the energy consumption of buildings with different types of heating and cooling systems. Find heating and cooling efficiency (energy consumption per square foot) for each type of system.

What are the most common fuel types used for water heating in buildings across different census regions?

Analyze how different window types (e.g., tinted, reflective) affect heating and cooling energy consumption.

Evaluate the impact of various lighting technologies (LED, fluorescent, etc.) and lighting control systems on a building's electricity consumption.

How does energy consumption (electricity, natural gas) vary with the size of the building (square footage)? Does efficiency increase or decrease with building size?

Does the year of construction affect the materials chosen for either roofs or walls?

What are the most common types of air conditioning and heating systems used in buildings, and how do they correlate with building size and type?
